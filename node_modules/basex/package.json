It uses the client interface via a socket connection to the BaseX server.\n\n[BaseX](http://basex.org/) is a very light-weight, high-performance and scalable\n XML Database engine and XPath/XQuery 3.0 Processor, \n including full support for the W3C Update and Full Text extensions.\nBuilt as a lightweight Java server, BaseX also supports XSLT, Webdav and RestXQ.  \n\n\n## Installing the BaseX Node client\n\nTo install with npm:\n\n`npm install basex`\n\n```bash\n\t$ mkdir myproject\n\tcd myproject\n\t$ npm install basex\n\tbasex@0.6.0 ./node_modules/basex \n```\n\nOnce BaseX is installed and the BaseX server is running, test it. \n\n```bash\n\t$ cd examples/\n\t$ node Example.js \n\tmilliseconds: 0\n\t{ result: '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10',\n\t  info: '\\nQuery executed in 0.38 ms.\\n' }\n\tend\n\tclose\n```\n\n## Installing BaseX\n1.
